This guide should help get your own local VSCode Workspace setup with the required extensions for work within this ENGG2000/3000 Unit! (If you have any issues, please contact Toast or refer to online docs)

## Setup

1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't already installed them on your machine.
2. Download Python at Version [3.12.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/)
(To confirm your install, head to your terminal and insert either "python --version" or "python3 --version")
3. Clone this repo to your local machine
4. Open VSCode and select File > "Open Workspace from Folder"
5. When prompted, accept and download recommended extensions for this workspace
6. To finish installing PlatformIO, on the left hand menu select the alien icon for PlatformIO
7. Once done, reload your VSCode window
8. For some devices, they may natively support the chipset used to communicate between an ESP32 and your device, in case the ESP32 is not recognised, download the following driver with the correct version for your system, [install](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)
